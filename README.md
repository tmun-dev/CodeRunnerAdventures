# CodeRunnerAdventures
Gamified Programming Lessons for Children!
Code Runner Adventures was a game project developed as part of my university dissertation, designed to introduce children to programming in a fun and engaging way.

My own journey into programming began with game development—starting with a 2D version of Minecraft built in VB.NET Forms.
While not the most ideal game development environment, its limitations taught me valuable problem-solving skills and reinforced my passion for coding.
With Code Runner Adventures, my goal was to create an accessible and child-friendly introduction to programming. Through vibrant abstract visuals and classic platformer-style gameplay, I aimed to make coding an exciting and approachable experience for young learners—helping to grow the next generation of programmers.
